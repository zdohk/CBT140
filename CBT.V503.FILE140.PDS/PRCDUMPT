+ The%DUMP+function submits a DF/DSS jobstream that will archive to tape
+ storage all Userid-prefixed datasets residing on PUBLIC storage (DASD)
+ that have been unreferenced for 365 days from the DUMP run date. This
+ function performed by data processing operations personnel sometime       is
+ during the las week of each quarter. One tape per quarter is created.    t
+ For each public disk volume (USERnn) dumped, a seperate tape file is
+ created. Archived ta are retained for 3 years. Output from the DUMP JOB  pes
+ is written as members dataset 'ABL.ARCDASD.REPORTS'. Member names are of to
+ the form USRnqqyy wher 'n' = last character of the disk volser, qqyy =   e
+ quarter and year when the dump occurred.   For example, membername
+ USR20390 would contain a list  o all user datasets archived from volume  f
+ USER02 during the 3Q90 DUMP run.  The tape VOLSER used during each
+ quarterly DUMP will be AR0qyy. The quart and year are supplied in the    er
+ DUMP panel as follows:
+
+   Enter the one-digit%QUARTER+===> Enter a 1 digit value from 1 to 4
%
+   Enter the two-digit%YEAR+   ===> Enter a 2 digit value from 89 to 99
