+     The integrity of mainframe-resident data is ensured by the automatic
+    dumping of all online (disk) data to magnetic tape storage on a weekly
+    interval.  These dumps are transparent to the user. A list of all
+    online data owned by your TSO userid can be obtained by selecting
+    option 3.4 from SPF's "ABL PRIMARY MENU".  In addition to the weekly
+    backups, on a quarterly schedule, data that has been unreferenced for
+    one year is archived to tape storage. These two distinct backup cycles
+    (weekly and quarterly) are further described in the online tutorials
+    that cover the specific Data Archival/Recovery System's options.
