+ This function provides the ability to%RESTORE+to online disk storage a
+ dataset that has been dumped as part of the%weekly+full-volume DASD dumps.
+ Weekly dump tapes are reused after two weekly dump cycles. No filtration
+ criteria is applied to the weekly dumps; any and all data on a disk volume
+ (VTOC) is dumped to tape (with the CATALOG not considered).  Access to
+ RESTORE capability is LIMITED to data processing personnel.
+
+
+ Completion of the following fields are required for a RESTORE to occur:
+
%   RESTORE dataset  ===>+E.g.,%D060849.SAMPLE.DATA+
%
%     TO Disk volume ===>+E.g.,%USER02+(Determined using hardcopy VTOC listings
+                         which are produced automatically during weekly dumps)
+
%          Using DUMP tape VOLSER(s)  ===>+E.g.,%000001,PRIVAT+ (Determined via
+                                          the weekly dump's JOB LOG)
